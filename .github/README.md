# dots

nothing to see here ma'am just some miserly dot files

used on win + mac + linux but most configuration is linux focused, includes weird things like renaming xdg directories

uses `dots` alias to manage in git without a big mess, system adapted from [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)

run `.bootstrap.sh` to bootstrap configuration (on linux), can be done easily with `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/will-rigney/.dots/master/.bootstrap.sh | /bin/bash`
