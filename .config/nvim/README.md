## todo

- [*] figure out completion properly - mostly done with cmp plugin
- [*] autopairs
- [ ] filetypes: e.g. correct tabstop, editor_config support
- [ ] better keymap for selecting completion from popup, scrolling hover
- [ ] q to quit instead of record macro in hover + help window
- [ ] correctly autoformat config files for absolute consistency
- [ ] treesitter implementation of go to definition, etc when no lsp in use

- [*] change zellij keybinds to not have resize or pane options (don't think I would ever use these anyway, stick to tabs)
  - see how this goes

### stretch

- [ ] org mode?

More contained in the files, should do a grep and copy them all here.
